# BaseMap2GoogleEarth

These set of Python scripts creates a grid around a set of layers that make up an organizations basemap turning all of the layers into sectioned KMLs/KMZs that Google Earth can display correctly. Some steps need to be taken to set up the scripts before they can be ran correctly. They need to be pointed to all of the right MXDs, datasets, and Windows Explorer folders which can be found in the scripts.
